						<h3>Beer Run - Update 9 - 25/09/2015</h3>
						<p>This week we had some testing done by our teachers and recieved some very helpful feedback. We are taking the teachers feedback and are using it to change the look of the game. As it stands the game is a bit dark so we have decided to literally rip the roof off of our stadium to make the game lighter along with changing wall and seat colours to assist in giving the game a lighter, happier and more comic look. We look forward to updating you some more on the progress of our game.</p>

						<h3>Beer Run - Update 8 - 18/09/2015</h3>
						<p>We have had some set backs this week with the use of Facebook causing us problems and we have ended up scrapping it for the time being. As bad as it may sound this was a blessing in surprise which opened our eyes to the fact that we need to be able to have people playing the game without needing to log into facebook. Things have steadied with the use of a new database Parse going very well.</p>
